                "Do not buy from here, bought a car from here and whilst on my drive home after collection my car had multiple lights on my dash board and was unsafe to drive, when I called the dealership they instructed me to drive it home, I did not feel safe doing so, so I attempted to drive it back but my car slowed right down, luckily I was able to park in a safe area. Eventually they sent someone to pick up the car which took hours to arrive. turns out there was issues with the abs system and would have to order parts from the manufacturer which would take days to arrive as well as fix. Although I am in the process of getting a refund  I do not recommend buying from here as they do not check their cars as thoroughly as they say they do, I feel like this is due to them having too much cars therefore the quality of car to each car is lost. also their test drives are not long enough to be able to determine any issues, as I know if I had a longer test drive the issue I embarked on my way home would have occurred on the test drive. Another issue is that they do not include warranty with their purchase instead they charge extortionate prices , for example for one year warranty it cost me £500.\nOverall just because they are a well know brand doesn’t mean their good. Do not buy from there",

                "I’m quite disappointed with my recent experience. A few weeks ago, I purchased a car from them, and right from the start, it was problematic. Despite having an appointment, the representative didn’t seem knowledgeable about the car.\nWe liked the vehicle, so I went to collect it the next day. However, upon returning home, I discovered there was no charging cable included, which is essential for an electric vehicle. To make matters worse, there was an extra scratch on the back bumper. They attempted to suggest that I hadn’t properly inspected the car before taking it, but I believe that a car worth £30K should be delivered in the condition advertised.\nA few days later, I also found out that the spare key card doesn’t work. Now, they’re telling me to deal with Tesla directly. I wonder what other issues might arise. I strongly advise others to reconsider purchasing from them, and I’ll be sharing my experience with friends and on social media.",

                "walked in to buy myself a new car with both my dad and grandad. As we walked through the entrance we asked to sit at a booth and discuss new cars (as my grandad was tired and wanted to sit) however we were told rudely that wasn’t possible and to do it over the counter. We walked towards them and discussed few cars options, after that, the staff member Muhammad C had asked my dad what his nationality/ ethnicity was. My dad told him “that’s not a professional questions to ask and is very irrelevant”. The conversation then escalated and we told the manager about this inconvenience. As we were leaving, we heard and saw Muhammed gather his colleagues to tell them what has happened right infront of us and had loudly said “disrespectful” about my dad. They’re clearly unhappy to help and not willing to serve customers with professionalism. Not recommended at all. Rude staff and an overall unpleasant experience. Unhelpful too.",

                "Having had a really bad experience in Big Motoring world, I came back to car giant. I have now purchased 3 cars from here and never been disappointed.\n\nJust purchased a gorgeous car, Edrian was with us and has incredible customer service skills. Talked us thorough everything, took us on a test drive and explained warranty etc. he was upfront and honest, didn’t try to mislead or oversell.\n\nFinance guy was also really good & prompt.\nThe day we came in, everyone was so friendly, helpful & welcoming. We felt at ease. The process of doing the paperwork, money and overall admin was smooth and quick.\n\nWe came back to collect the car, all documents & transfers were done virtually so it’s a smooth collection process. The guy on collections was very helpful & friendly. Very quick process, sadly dvla road tax website was down but he advised us where we could get this done. When website was back on, he gave me a courtesy call to advise me it was back up and running which was kind of him.\n\nOverall, super happy with my experience, got my car! Staff are amazing & knowledgable, not pushy. They know their products & services. DO NOT GO BIG MOTORING WORLD! I’d highly recommend car giant no doubt. Keep refreshing their website as they get new cars daily. Took me 3 trips to CG in 1 week to finally find the perfect one for me!",

Awesome that there is also drive away insurance you can take out to get you home if you’ve not already got insurance in place.

                "The cars are very competitively priced but the car buying process is incredibly long!\n\nI must start my review by saying how impressed I was with the fantastic service provided by Junior. He was a great salesman - extremely knowledgeable, not pushy,  personable and he had a good sense of humour too. Amir in the collection department also gave great customer service.\n\nEven if you pay the reservation fee beforehand, you are not part exchanging, or getting finance and there are no issues with the car - you'd still be there for 2-3 hours. This was explained by the salesman to manage our expectations, but I feel this is too long and in hindsight I would rather pay a tad more from somewhere with a quicker turnaround.\n\nWe had previously bought a car from Cargiant 10 years ago, that time we got finance and part exchanged our old car. This time however, we paid cash and did not part exchange, so I wrongly believed after having chosen the car that we would be in and out in well under 2 hours.\n\nThe reason I have scored 2 stars was because -  after agreeing to buy the car, we were given a collection time. Upon the collection time we were told that it needed a part fitting, which had to be ordered in. We were asked to return in an hour for an update but unfortunately the part had not arrived. So after having spent just over 4 hours there, we had to return another day.\n\nIn fairness, the service representative did say that we could cancel and get any money back that we'd paid for a reservation etc. It was very frustrating that the fault with the car was not spotted earlier in the process.",
